## Intro

![The modern human struggle.](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/spam.jpg "computerhope.com")

Let's look at data labelled as either spam or non-spam. Every column (except for the response variable 'type') is a keyword, every row is a specific observation of a single email, and the values are relative frequencies of the keyword in that particular email.

```{r loadData, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
data(spam) # Email spam dataset from kernlab lib
kable(head(spam), caption = "First few rows of spam dataset")
```

## Summary of Data

The keyword 'you'
```{r}
sum.you <- summary(spam$you)
sum.you
```
has mean frequency `r sum.you['Mean']`

The keyword 'capitalAve'
```{r}
summary(spam$capitalAve)
```

The type of email, spam or nonspam
```{r}
summary(spam$type)
```
